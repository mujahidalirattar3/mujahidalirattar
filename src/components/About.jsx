                Hi, I'm <strong>Mujahid Ali Rattar</strong>, a passionate{" "}
                <strong>Web Developer</strong> with expertise in{" "}
                <strong>React</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>IT Administrator</strong>. From
                creating my personal portfolio to developing web
                applications, I've always been excited about leveraging
                technology to create impactful solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                My journey in software development began with HTML and CSS, but
                it was when I learned JavaScript and the power of{" "}
                <strong>React</strong> that my passion for web development truly
                ignited. I specialize in building scalable and performant web
                applications with a strong focus on user experience and clean,
                maintainable code.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                Currently, I am working as a part of a collaborative team on
                various projects, including an{" "}
                <strong>E-commerce platform</strong> built using the React.
                I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and always seek
                opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
              </p>
              <p className="text-justify ">
                When I'm not developing web applications, youâ€™ll find me
                fine-tuning my motorcycle, exploring off-road trails, or
                organizing spaces to create a productive environment. I also
                enjoy occasional chess games with good company and dabble in SEO
                and UI/UX research to stay informed on modern digital trends.
